## Regex Components

### Anchors - An anchor is either a dollar sign or the carrot symbol. If the carot is at the begining it means it will have to match.  If the dollar sign is at the end it means it will have to match at the end
Example of anchors

### Quantifiers - matches characters in your code. Instead of writing the same thing over and over you can you Quantifiers to match it.

### Grouping Constructs - this matches groups of characters by putting parentheses around the groups to change the outcome.  The parentheses are put around them so you can match the groups

### Bracket Expressions - bracket expressions gives you the option to choose different characters.  When you add anything to the bracket, it means that you can use it.  You can do a letter range like this [a-z] this means that you can use any letter from a-z

### Character Classes  are characters written in brackets, in regular expressions any character that is used in the bracket will be considered a match.

### Flags this is the all match. If you have characters that would not normally match, you can select all or dot all to flag it for everything to show.

### Character Escapes is when the users wants to check or search on the exact text.  They will check by putting a back slash before the text.
